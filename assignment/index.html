    <p>Is "let" what is most commonly used?  Throughout my searches I never saw let being used.</p>

    <p>Outside of coursework, where can I go to get additional practice for js?</p>

    <p>It seems that all of my code is working properly and is coded correctly (we will see if the grading reflects
      that); however, I am not making any "aha" connenctions.  i.e. I understand how to write the code but I am not
      understanding when/why I would use it.  I am assuming some of that will come as we dive deeper into js but I
      want to be certain that I am not missing anything.</p>
